Descending into the valley where the caves are located is a lengthy walkway made up of about 317 steps said to have been constructed by the Anambra State Government in the mid 90s. At the end of the walkway is an open space used as a reception point where visitors are by tradition to remove their shoes."

Hidden away from the busy routes that crisscross Anambra, the Ogbaukwu Caves and Waterfalls are located in Owerre Ezeukala community that borders three other states: Abia, Enugu and Imo. It is approximately 75 kilometres east of Onitsha. The Ogba Ukwu cave is considered to be one of the largest cave in West Africa, which will take upwards to two hours to explore."

          "description": "This is a long and still lake at the outskirts of the town.  The far end of the lake is in Oko town where the Federal Polytechnic is located.  The lake is as quiet as the Dead Sea and no aquatic life has been recorded in it.  The mystery behind the lake is that till date no case of drowning of an indigene of the community has been recorded. Mrs. Rose Ezeh, wife of the present Town Union Chairman once fell into the lake and it was about one hour later that rescuers were able to reach her.  Clearly expecting the worst, the locals were however mystified to discover that she had not taken in one single gulp of water.  As soon as she was rescued, she woke up and went home."
